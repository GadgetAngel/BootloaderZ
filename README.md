# Bootloader-Z

This is a custom STM32F4xx bootloader that allows flashing firmware binaries via USB.

The project is a modified version of [Serasidis/STM32_HID_Bootloader](https://github.com/Serasidis/STM32_HID_Bootloader), converted to PlatformIO and using the default STM32Cube framework.

Detailed instructions for use will follow soon.
