# Bootloader-Z

# IMPORTANT: This software, as any bootloader out there, might brick your device. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.

This is a custom STM32F4xx bootloader that allows flashing firmware binaries via USB.

The project is a modified version of [Serasidis/STM32_HID_Bootloader](https://github.com/Serasidis/STM32_HID_Bootloader), adapted to PlatformIO and using the STM32Cube framework.

Detailed instructions for use will follow soon.
